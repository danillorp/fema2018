abstract = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) [G.-B. Huang, Q.-Y. Zhu, C.-K. Siew, Extreme learning machine: a new learning scheme of feedforward neural networks, in: Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN2004), Budapest, Hungary, 25â€“29 July 2004], a novel learning algorithm much faster than the traditional gradient-based learning algorithms, was proposed recently for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). However, \{ELM\} may need higher number of hidden neurons due to the random determination of the input weights and hidden biases. In this paper, a hybrid learning algorithm is proposed which uses the differential evolutionary algorithm to select the input weights and Mooreâ€“Penrose (MP) generalized inverse to analytically determine the output weights. Experimental results show that this approach is able to achieve good generalization performance with much more compact networks.}
