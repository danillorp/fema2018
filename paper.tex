\begin{abstract}
Machine learning has played an important role in the past decades, being in lockstep with the main advances in computer technology. Given the massive amount of data generated daily, there is a need for even faster and effective learning algorithms that can provide updated models for real-time applications and on-demand tools. In this paper, we propose FEMa - A Finite Element Machine classifier - for supervised learning problems, where each training sample is the center of a basis function, and the whole training set is modeled as a probabilistic manifold for classification purposes. FEMa has its theoretical basis in the Finite Element Method, which is widely used for numeral analysis in engineering problems. We show FEMa is parameterless and it has a quadratic complexity for both training and classification phases when we use basis functions that obey some properties, as well as the proposed classifier can obtain very competitive results when compared against some state-of-the-art supervised pattern recognition techniques.
